Banking apps 🏦, Android phones 📱, enterprise servers 🖥️, ATMs 💳, smart TVs 📺—Java is quietly running the world while sipping coffee ☕. But Java didn't start as a global superstar. Its journey is full of pivots, smart decisions, accidental discoveries, and a little bit of luck. Let's rewind the clock and explore this fascinating story! 🎬",

Their goal was NOT to create a programming language for developers—instead, they wanted a language for consumer electronics. Plot twist: They ended up creating something way bigger! 🎯",
