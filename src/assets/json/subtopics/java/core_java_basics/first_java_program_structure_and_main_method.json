      "question": "What is the sequence of execution in a Java program?",
      "answer": "1) Compile: javac creates .class bytecode. 2) Run: java command starts JVM. 3) JVM loads the class into memory. 4) JVM searches for public static void main(String[] args). 5) Execution begins from first statement in main. 6) Statements execute sequentially. 7) main ends, program terminates.",

      "question": "Why must the public class name match the filename?",
      "answer": "In Java, if a class is declared public, the filename must exactly match the class name (case-sensitive) with .java extension. This helps JVM locate the class file. It's a design decision for organization and clarity. One file can have only one public class, but multiple non-public classes.",

      "question": "What is System.out.println()?",
      "answer": "System.out.println() is used to print output to console. System is a class in java.lang, 'out' is a static PrintStream object, println() is a method that prints and adds a newline. It's the most common way to display output in Java programs.",

      "question": "Can we overload the main method?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can overload main method by creating methods with the same name but different parameters. However, JVM will only call public static void main(String[] args) as the entry point. Other overloaded versions must be called explicitly from within the program.",
